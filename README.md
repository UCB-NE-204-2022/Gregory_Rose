Here is the google drive necessary to access the raw data files. You'll need a Berkeley e-mail to access it.

Download the data file you wish to use (Cs-137, Co-60). Open the associated Jupyter Notebook. You will have to adjust the file location to wherever you have saved the data file, but after that, just run the notebook.
